Weeklong Project Roadmap: Task Management System
Day 1: Setup and Backend Development

Setup MongoDB:

Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.
Create a new MongoDB database for your task management system.
Setup Node.js and Express.js:

Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install Express.js and set up your server file (server.js).
Establish MongoDB connection using Mongoose to interact with the database.
Define Data Models:

Design MongoDB schemas for projects and tasks.
Define relationships between projects and tasks (e.g., one-to-many).
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for projects and tasks using Mongoose.
Day 2-3: Frontend Development with React
4. Setup React App:

Initialize a new React app using Create React App or a similar tool.
Set up necessary dependencies like Axios for making HTTP requests.
Create Components:

Design UI components for displaying projects, tasks, and task details.
Implement forms for creating and editing projects/tasks.
Implement Routing:

Set up React Router for navigation between different pages (e.g., project list, task details).
Define routes for viewing, creating, and editing projects/tasks.
Day 4-5: Integration and Functionality
7. Implement Task Management Features:

Add functionality to create new projects and tasks.
Allow users to assign tasks to team members and set due dates.
Implement task status tracking (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").

User Authentication:
Integrate user authentication to secure the application.
Allow users to register, login, and logout.
Ensure that only authenticated users can access project/task-related functionalities.
